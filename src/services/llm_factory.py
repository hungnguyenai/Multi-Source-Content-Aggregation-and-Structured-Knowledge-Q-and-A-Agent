"""AgentCore Platform v1.0"""

# Builds the LLM client the platform actually provisions: Azure OpenAI.
#
# Why this file exists: the Marketplace entry point constructs the agent with no
# config, so a node that takes its client from `config["llm"]` receives None on
# every invocation and silently falls through to its deterministic branch. An
# agent designed around an LLM then never uses one, with no error and nothing in
# the response to show for it. Building the client here — from the credentials
# the platform injects — is what actually puts an LLM behind the agent.
#
# Why Azure only: the registered environment supplies AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT and AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT, and the image ships the
# `openai` extra. No other provider's credentials or client library are present,
# so probing for them would be dead code. One template keeps a provider-probing
# variant for the case where a different credential is issued.
#
# Returning None is a supported outcome, not a failure: the deterministic branch
# is a working path, and taking an agent down over a packaging or configuration
# problem it cannot fix would be worse than degrading.
